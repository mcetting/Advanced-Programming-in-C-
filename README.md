# Advanced-Programming-in-C-
This is a repository containing the work i completed for my advanced programming class at UCSC.

The first assignment is an c++ implementation of the dc function from unix. It used special objects to handle calculations so that their is no upper or lower digit limit.

The second assignment was about recreating a file structure similar to the one used in unix and navigating it with the same commands.

I cant remember for the life of me what the third program is.

The fourth assignment is a graphical program using opengl to display graphics on a screen and interact with them using mouse and unix commands.

The fifth assignment is a file sharing server and client program. Its used to transfer files between two computers using the daemon and client applications attatched.
